                        Programming is a skill that is valued highly among multiple career choices including but not limited to most of the engineering fields.
						However, even for those who are not planning to study engineering, computer science is still a valuable field to learn about.
						Programming is a tool that can be used to automize many rigorous tasks and give developers unrestrictive access to what they can create.
						When placed in the right hands, programming can lead to the creation of both artistic and usefull works.
						Most importantly, programming teaches valuable life skills such as problem solving, creativity, and critical thinking.
						At the Programming Club, we will mostly be focused on these 3 essential aspects of programming.
						We will be looking into methods to tackle difficult problems and learn algorithms that aid towards making fast and efficient programs.
						The Programming Club will also be a great expirience to learn how to work as a team and how to create production ready code.
						We will be working on group projects, such as developing the ASFM CCE Website, use widely popular, colaborative tools, such as git, and work to re-establish the yearly hackathon competition.

                        Problem 4:
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        There are n fishermen who have just returned from a fishing trip. The i-th fisherman has caught a fish of size a. <br> <br>
                        The fishermen will choose some order in which they are going to tell the size of the fish they caught (the order is just a permutation of size n ). However, they are not entirely honest, and they may "increase" the size of the fish they have caught.
                        <br> <br>
                        Formally, suppose the chosen order of the fishermen is [p1,p2,p3,â€¦,pn]. Let bi be the value which the i-th fisherman in the order will tell to the other fishermen. The values bi are chosen as follows:

                        <ul style="padding-left:40px;">
                            <li>
                                the first fisherman in the order just honestly tells the actual size of the fish he has caught, so b1=ap1; 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                every other fisherman wants to tell a value that is strictly greater than the value told by the previous fisherman, and is divisible by the size of the fish that the fisherman has caught. So, for i>1, bi is the smallest integer that is both strictly greater than b1 and divisible by pi. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            Input <br>
                        </b>
                        The first line contains one integer n
                        (1â‰¤nâ‰¤1000) â€” the number of fishermen. <br> <br>
